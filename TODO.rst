To do
=====

- Create integration tests
- Support *various* types of animations
- Support creation of animations by upload of an achive file
  (e.g. ``.zip`` or ``.tar.gz``)
- Fully integratable animations (which don't need an HTML page on their own)
- Static thumbnails:

  - Remove *hard* dependency on visaplan.plone.staticthumbnails_
  - Fix the ZCA_ wiring to obsolete the inheritance from the mixin class

Contributions welcome!
